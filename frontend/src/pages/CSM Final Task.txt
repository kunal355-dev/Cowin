I would first listen to all the points AM is mentioning about the company. And then as a CSM I would calculate all the required entities for the marketing firm as Churn, Retention, Net Retention, Gross Retention, NPS Score, CSAT, etc.
After I get all the data and statistics I would then try to optimize the company workflow, use new integrations and automations, introduce new features in the workflow and try to make it as better as possible. Organize multiple face-to-face sessions with company's each section account and try to meet their goals.
I will also look forward to train the border team to explain the workflows created for them during the account creation phase and meet the end users needs. I'll get to know all the champions and the ownerships on the account. Equip them with monday.com current tools and drive adoption and eventually extend the account usage. Conduct clinic sessions, understand issues and try to improve the relevant users. After all this I would conduct daily checkups for the account to get all necessary reports such as WAPP % , Engagement, Health Score, etc.
And after about 3-6 months I'll will organize an EBR session for the marketing company to tell the company about how monday.com brings value to it.
